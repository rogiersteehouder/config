# Configuration files

My configuration files for various applications and systems.

## Main

Configuration files that are pretty much universal, because the applications
run on multiple systems.

- archive_py: configuration for my own archive script.
- git: user config and global ignore file.
- hg: symlink .hgrc, style and a homemade extension (unmaintained, because I switched to git).
- python: list of packages for pip.
- sqlite3: symlink ~/.sqliterc
- vscodium: settings and snippets.

## Unix

Configuration files for common applications on unix-like systems.

- bash: symlink .bashrc, symlink .profile (unmaintained, because I switched to fish).
- fish: config, variables, functions.
- nvim: just reads .vimrc.
- screen: symlink .screenrc (unmaintained, because I switched to tmux).
- tmux: config
- tmuxp: a "main" setup with two windows and a split pane
- vim: symlink .vimrc.
- _inputrc: symlink .inputrc

## Windows

Configuration files for common applications on windows systems.

- cmd: copy init.cmd to your user directory

  init.reg adds %USERPROFILE%/init.cmd to the command prompt as auto-run
