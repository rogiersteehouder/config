# Configuration files

My configuration files for various applications and systems.

## Main

Configuration files that are pretty much universal, because the applications
run on multiple systems.

- archive_py: configuration for my own archive script.
- git: user config and global ignore file.
- hg: symlink .hgrc, style and a homemade extension (unmaintained, because I switched to git).
- python: list of packages for pip.
- sqlite3: symlink ~/.sqliterc
- vscodium: settings and snippets.
